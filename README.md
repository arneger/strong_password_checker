# strong_password_checker
A python script that checks if your password is strong or weak. 
The function takes a string (the password) as an argument and returns True if the password is strong and False if the password is weak. 
The criteria for it to be strong is that it contains at least 3 different special characters, 
3 different numbers and that the total length is 10 or more characters.

Some changes I could do to the criteria in the function:
- Password need to have at least one capital letter
- Password need to have more letters in it.
- Have at least 2 numbers and 2 special characters instead of 3.
